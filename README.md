placeholder-compat
==================

JavaScript compatibility script for html placeholder attribute.


Background
----------

Almost all current browsers support the placeholder attribute that can be used to display text in empty input fields. This method is often used for labels. If a browser does not support this attribute, an empty input without label will be shown.

This script uses JavaScript to add support for placeholders also for browsers that do not have native support for it (e.g. Internet Explorer < 10, Opera Mini).


Requirements
------------

This script requires [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).


Usage
-----

See ```example.html``` for example usage.

In short: Link jQuery, ```placeholder-compat.min.js``` and ```placeholder-compat.css``` in your html head.
